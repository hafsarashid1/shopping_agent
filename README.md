🛍️ AI Shopping Agent — Powered by Gemini & Python 🤖

An AI-powered Shopping Assistant that understands natural language and helps users shop smarter!
This project uses Google Gemini, Agents Framework, and Python to simulate an intelligent shopping experience — fetching real product data, answering queries, and behaving just like a real customer service bot.

🚀 What It Can Do

✅ Fetch real products from an external API
✅ List prices, availability, and categories
✅ Answer shopping-related questions like delivery time, offers, and return policy
✅ Generate conversational, human-like responses using Gemini reasoning

🧠 Tech Stack

Language Model: Google Gemini (via OpenAI-compatible API)

Framework: Agents & Runner (for agentic reasoning)

Libraries: Requests, Rich (for colorful CLI outputs), Dotenv

Language: Python

⚙️ How It Works

The agent is designed to:

Take a user’s shopping-related query 💬

Call the get_products() function to fetch data 📦

Use Gemini’s reasoning model to respond intelligently and contextually ✨

🧩 Example Queries

“Show me a short list of products (just names and prices please)”
“Do you offer same-day delivery in Karachi?”
“What’s your return policy?”

💡 Future Improvements

🔹 Add delivery tracking and cancellation tools
🔹 Support multi-turn conversations
🔹 Connect to real e-commerce APIs

🌟 Why I Built This

To explore how agentic AI and function calling can make virtual shopping assistants more interactive, useful, and human-like.
Every iteration of this project deepened my understanding of tool-based reasoning and AI agent workflows.
